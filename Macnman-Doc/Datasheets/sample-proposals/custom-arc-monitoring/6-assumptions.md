## Conditions and Assumptions

### Compliance
- Design will comply with **CE** and **WPC** requirements.  
- Pre-compliance testing will be performed before final certification submission.

### Unique Serial Code
- Every sensor will include a **unique serial code**, printed either on the PCB or via an external sticker.  
- This serial code enables precise device identification during installation and future maintenance.

### Manufacturing & Procurement
- Component lead times may impact production and delivery schedules.  
- The customer will be informed proactively of any delays due to procurement constraints.  
- Any component substitutions (due to EOL or availability issues) will require **customer approval** before implementation.

### Scope Changes
- Any hardware or firmware feature request beyond the defined scope will be treated as a **separate project**.  
- Such changes may impact cost, timelines, and deliverables and will require formal approval from both parties.
