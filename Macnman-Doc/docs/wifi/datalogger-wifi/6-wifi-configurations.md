MacSync automatically scans and displays nearby Wi-Fi networks.

**Scan for Networks**
- Click the refresh icon to initiate a new scan. **Wait a few seconds** while MacSync discovers nearby Wi-Fi hotspots.

**Connect to a Network**
- Once the list appears, **select your preferred network** and enter the Wi-Fi password to connect.

**Status Check**
- The connection status will be shown next to the network name. You can click the arrow next to any network to view **detailed connection information.** 

Example : `Connection Status` , `WiFi Version` , `Security` , `Signal Strength` & `IP Address`.
