# Overview

## MAC32WBLE5 LoRa Module

The **MAC32WBLE5** is a compact, ultra-low-power wireless module that combines the long-range communication of LoRaWAN with the short-range versatility of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), enabling seamless hybrid connectivity for next-generation IoT devices. Developed by Macnman Technologies Pvt Ltd, this module integrates two best-in-class MCUs: the **STM32WL** series for LoRa and the Nordic **nRF52** series for BLE.

This dual-core architecture allows simultaneous operation of LoRa and BLE, unlocking unique capabilities such as long-range data transmission to the cloud and local device provisioning or diagnostics via smartphone or tablet. The MAC32WBLE5 comes with a pre-certified LoRaWAN¬Æ protocol stack and supports BLE 5.0, making it ideal for secure, scalable, and energy-efficient applications.

With its small footprint, robust RF performance, and ultra-low power design, the MAC32WBLE5 is perfectly suited for battery-powered devices operating in remote or challenging environments.
