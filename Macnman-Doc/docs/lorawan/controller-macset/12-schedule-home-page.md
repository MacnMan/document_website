The **Schedule Home** page offers a user-friendly interface to automate your controller’s relay operations. Here's what you can do:

## Schedule Types
Choose from 3 powerful scheduling modes:
- **Regular** — Fixed ON/OFF time-based operation
- **Cyclic** — Repeated ON/OFF cycles within a time window
- **Trigger** — Relay activation based on live sensor conditions (e.g., temperature, level, etc.)

## Day & Time Selection
- Configure **which days** of the week each schedule should be active
- Define **start and stop times** for each schedule

## Independent Relay Control
- Toggle **Relay 1** and **Relay 2** independently
- Each relay can have its own schedule and behavior

## Multiple Schedule Support
- Add and manage up to **9 unique alarms per controller**
- Each alarm can have a separate label, type, time, and action

These features allow for flexible automation of pumps, fans, lights, irrigation systems, and more — saving energy, effort, and manual intervention.
