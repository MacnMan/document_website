## Device Name

![Macnman Name Change](/img/controller/lora-controller-macset/controller_name_change.svg)

You can rename your device to something meaningful for easier identification â€” such as its location, function, or deployment area.

- **Example**  
  `SoilSensor_Greenhouse1` , `TempLogger_WarehouseB`

Device names can be **up to 20 characters long**. Use short, meaningful names for quick recognition during field operations.

## Change Heartbeat

**What is Heartbeat?**  
Heartbeat defines how often the device sends a status update to the server, even when no sensor data has changed. It helps confirm that the device is active and communicating.

- **Example**  
  If the heartbeat is set to `15 minutes`, the device will send a signal to the server every 15 minutes, regardless of data changes

A lower heartbeat interval provides more frequent status checks but may increase power consumption on battery-powered devices.s
