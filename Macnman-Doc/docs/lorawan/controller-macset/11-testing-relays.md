You can manually test the relays locally using on-screen toggle buttons before final deployment.

![three phase application](/img/controller/test_realys.svg)

- Each relay has a dedicated **toggle switch** in the Maya app or web interface.
- Toggling allows you to **turn the relay ON or OFF instantly** for quick validation.
- Useful for checking **wiring, device response**, and **basic functionality** without needing to set up a full schedule.



:::warning

**Manual toggling will override any ongoing schedule or automation during testing**. Make sure to re-enable the desired automation afterward if needed.
