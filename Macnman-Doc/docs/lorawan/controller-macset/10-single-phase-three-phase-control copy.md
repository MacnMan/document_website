If you are controlling **single-phase motors or pumps**, choose the **Single-Phase** option.

- The MacSet allows **independent control of two separate devices** using its dual relay outputs.
- Ideal for applications that require control over **two low-power systems**, such as water pumps or fans.

## Three-Phase Control

If your setup includes **three-phase motors or pumps**, choose the **Three-Phase** option.

- MacSet utilizes **both relays in combination** to manage a single three-phase device.
- Ensures **synchronized and safe switching** for high-power industrial applications.

> Selecting the correct application type ensures the relays are configured properly for your end use.s
