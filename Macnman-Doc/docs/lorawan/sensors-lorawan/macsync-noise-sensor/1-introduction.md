# MacSync-LN1

## Product Overview

**MacSync-LN1** is a compact and highly reliable LoRaWAN® noise sensor designed to monitor ambient sound levels in real-time across both indoor and outdoor settings. It offers high-resolution sound measurement over a wide frequency range, making it ideal for smart city deployments, industrial compliance, and community noise monitoring.

With a rugged, weather-resistant enclosure (IP66-rated) and ultra-low power design, MacSync-LN1 is built for long-term deployment in diverse environments. Its integrated lithium battery supports years of maintenance-free operation, while its LoRaWAN® Class A & C compatibility enables flexible uplink strategies, including threshold-triggered and periodic data reporting.

Configuration is simple and wireless using the [**Macnman Maya App**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.macnman.app&pcampaignid=web_share) over Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). Users can quickly adjust thresholds, intervals, and review device data from their mobile phone—no technical expertise required.

Fully compatible with Macnman gateways and platforms, MacSync-LN1 enables smarter noise compliance, proactive alerts, and data-driven urban planning initiatives.
