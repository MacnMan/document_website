# MacSync-LCO21

## Product Overview

The **MacSync-LCO21** is a compact and intelligent LoRaWAN® CO₂ sensor built for real-time indoor air quality monitoring in smart buildings, greenhouses, industrial environments, and HVAC systems. Powered by advanced photoacoustic NDIR (PASens®) technology, it delivers high-precision carbon dioxide measurements, along with integrated temperature and humidity sensing.

Designed for ultra-low power operation and long-term deployment, MacSync-LCO21 transmits environmental data over LoRaWAN® networks for **remote monitoring, automation, and alerts.** Its robust build, small form factor, and seamless compatibility with Macnman gateways and platforms make it ideal for scalable air quality solutions.

Configuration is quick and user-friendly using the [**Macnman Maya App**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.macnman.app&pcampaignid=web_share), which leverages Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). Through the app, users can set parameters, adjust logging intervals, and manage data settings directly from their smartphone—no technical expertise required.
