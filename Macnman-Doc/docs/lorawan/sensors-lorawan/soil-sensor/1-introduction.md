# MacSync-LS7

## Product Overview

**MacSync-LS7** is a rugged and intelligent LoRaWAN® soil sensor designed to provide accurate, real-time monitoring of critical soil parameters across agricultural, environmental, and smart farming applications. This compact sensor integrates up to seven vital soil metrics including temperature, moisture, pH, NPK, EC, and more—delivering reliable insights to optimize irrigation, fertilization, and crop health.

Engineered with an IP68-rated enclosure and long-lasting power options, MacSync-LS7 ensures dependable performance in the harshest outdoor conditions. Its low-power design enables extended field deployments, while LoRaWAN® Class A & C support provides flexible and efficient wireless data transmission for timely decision-making and alert management.

Configuration is simple and wireless using the [**Macnman Maya App**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.macnman.app&pcampaignid=web_share) over Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). Users can quickly adjust thresholds, intervals, and review device data from their mobile phone—no technical expertise required.

Fully compatible with Macnman gateways and platforms, MacSync-LS7 enables smarter noise compliance, proactive alerts, and data-driven urban planning initiatives.
