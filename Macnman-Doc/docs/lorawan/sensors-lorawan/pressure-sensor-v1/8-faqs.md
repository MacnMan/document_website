----

#### What is the pressure range of the sensor?
It can measure up to 1.2 MPa (megapascals) and withstand a maximum pressure of 2.4 MPa. It is also built to handle destructive pressures up to 3.0 MPa.

----

#### How accurate is the MacSync-LPS1?
The sensor provides high accuracy with a measurement tolerance of ±1.5% Full Scale (FS), ensuring reliable readings in critical pressure monitoring scenarios.

----

#### Is it suitable for outdoor or industrial environments?
Yes. It is housed in an IP65/IP67-rated enclosure with durable ABS casing, designed for harsh conditions including moisture, dust, and wide temperature variations.

----

#### How is the MacSync-LPS1 powered?
The device includes a 19,000 mAh lithium battery for multi-year use. It also supports optional solar power integration for long-term, maintenance-free deployments.

----

#### How does the sensor communicate?
It communicates over LoRaWAN® (Class A & C) and supports periodic, threshold-based, and event-driven data uplinks for flexible data reporting.

----

#### Can I configure it remotely?
Yes. The MacSync-LPS1 supports remote configuration via LoRaWAN® downlinks and local Bluetooth access using the Macnman Maya App.

----

#### What are common use cases?
