# MacRay-LUltrasonic-Gen1

## Product Overview

**MacRay-Ultrasonic Gen1** is a rugged, industrial-grade LoRaWAN® ultrasonic distance sensor built for reliable and precise non-contact level measurements. Ideal for smart waste bins, tank level monitoring, and industrial fluid management, it delivers high accuracy in harsh environments.

Equipped with high acoustic power output, real-time auto calibration, and advanced noise rejection capabilities, MacRay-Ultrasonic ensures stable performance across variable surfaces and lighting conditions. It features an IP67 enclosure, supports LoRaWAN® Class A & C, and includes BLE support via the Maya app for easy configuration and diagnostics.

Configuration is simple and wireless using the [**Macnman Maya App**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.macnman.app&pcampaignid=web_share) over Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). Users can quickly adjust thresholds, intervals, and review device data from their mobile phone—no technical expertise required.
