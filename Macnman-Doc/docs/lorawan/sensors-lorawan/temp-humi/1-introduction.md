# MacSync-LT1

## Product Overview

The **MacSync-LT1 is a high-precision, low-power Temperature & Humidity sensor** designed for seamless integration into LoRaWAN® networks. Built with industrial-grade components and a robust enclosure, this sensor ensures reliable and accurate temperature monitoring across a wide range of applications. Whether you’re tracking environmental conditions in warehouses, cold storage units, or outdoor infrastructure, MacSync-LT1 delivers real-time Temperature & Humidity updates directly to your dashboard.

With a focus on durability, **wireless data transmission**, and **long battery life**, the MacSync-LT1 enables remote temperature monitoring with minimal maintenance, making it ideal for mission-critical and large-scale deployments.

Configuration is quick and user-friendly using the [**Macnman Maya App**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.macnman.app&pcampaignid=web_share), which leverages Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). Through the app, users can set parameters, adjust logging intervals, and manage data settings directly from their smartphone—no technical expertise required.
