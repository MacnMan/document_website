## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

#### What parameters does the MacSync Water Quality Sensor measure?
The sensor can measure up to 7 water quality parameters simultaneously, including dissolved oxygen, pH, ORP, conductivity/salinity, turbidity, ammonia nitrogen, and temperature.

----

#### Is the sensor suitable for continuous deployment in outdoor environments?
Yes. The sensor is IP68-rated and designed with robust materials for continuous underwater or harsh outdoor monitoring in lakes, rivers, tanks, and wastewater facilities.

----

#### How accurate are the sensor readings?
Each sensor module is individually calibrated and offers high accuracy across its specified range. For example, the pH sensor provides ±0.1 pH accuracy, and dissolved oxygen is accurate to ±2% F.S.

----

#### Does the sensor have a self-cleaning mechanism?
Yes. It is equipped with an automatic cleaning brush system to prevent biofouling and ensure consistent accuracy during long-term monitoring.

----

#### What communication protocol does it support?
The sensor communicates via RS-485 using the Modbus/RTU protocol. When integrated with the MacSync LoRaWAN® transmitter, the data is sent wirelessly over LoRaWAN® networks (Class A & C supported).

----

#### How is the sensor powered?
The MacSync water quality sensor system includes a 19,000 mAh battery for long-term operation. An optional solar panel can be used for maintenance-free outdoor deployment.

----

#### Can I access real-time and historical data?
Yes. Data is transmitted to the cloud through LoRaWAN®, and you can view real-time and historical sensor readings using the Macnman Maya platform.

----

#### What are the typical applications of this sensor?
This sensor is ideal for aquaculture monitoring, smart city water systems, wastewater treatment plants, irrigation water quality management, and industrial effluent monitoring.
