# MacSync-LW6

## Product Overview

**MacSync-LW6** is a compact, solar-powered LoRaWAN® weather station designed to monitor six key environmental parameters—temperature, humidity, wind speed, wind direction, atmospheric pressure, and rainfall. It delivers high-accuracy data over long-range wireless networks, enabling real-time monitoring and automation across remote and off-grid applications.

Built for rugged outdoor use, the device features a **UV-resistant**, IP66-rated enclosure that ensures durability in harsh climates. The integrated solar panel and internal backup battery offer maintenance-free operation for years, even in remote deployments. With LoRaWAN® Class A & C support, data can be sent periodically or triggered by custom thresholds and events.

Configuration is quick and user-friendly using the [**Macnman Maya App**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.macnman.app&pcampaignid=web_share), which leverages Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). Through the app, users can set parameters, adjust logging intervals, and manage data settings directly from their smartphone—no technical expertise required.

Seamlessly compatible with Macnman gateways and cloud platforms, MacSync-LW6 empowers smart agriculture, environmental research, infrastructure monitoring, and disaster prevention with actionable insights.
