# MacSync-LU7

## Product Overview

**MacSync-LU7** is a rugged industrial-grade LoRaWAN® ultrasonic sensor engineered for accurate, long-range, and non-contact measurement of distance, presence, or level across harsh environments. Whether monitoring water levels in tanks, detecting object clearance in factories, or ensuring flood risk alerts in storm drains, MacSync-LU7 delivers precise and reliable data wirelessly.

Designed to withstand demanding conditions with a weatherproof enclosure and advanced noise rejection capabilities, the sensor supports ultra-low power operations and extended field deployments. It leverages LoRaWAN® Class A & C protocols for seamless data integration, threshold-based alerts, and real-time automation across diverse industrial and smart infrastructure use cases.

Configuration is simple and wireless using the [**Macnman Maya App**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.macnman.app&pcampaignid=web_share) over Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). Users can quickly adjust thresholds, intervals, and review device data from their mobile phone—no technical expertise required.

Fully compatible with Macnman gateways and platforms, MacSync-LU7 enables smarter noise compliance, proactive alerts, and data-driven urban planning initiatives.
