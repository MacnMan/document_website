Macnman sensors operate in always-on mode, allowing them to be discovered at any time via Bluetooth.

- **Discover Devices**  
  Go to the **BLE Search tab** in the Maya app to scan for and list all nearby Macnman devices.

- **Connect to a Sensor**  
  Select the sensor you want to configure from the list.
  If **security is enabled, you may need authentication** based on the device’s security level.
  To restrict access, consider setting a higher security level to limit configuration to authorized users only.

- **Access Configuration**  
  Once connected, the app will automatically navigate to the device’s configuration page, where you can set parameters, update firmware, or view diagnostics.
