# Product Lifecycle & End-of-Life (EOL) Policy

Macnman Technologies Pvt. Ltd. is committed to providing long-term, reliable hardware solutions for industrial and mission-critical IoT deployments.  
This Product Lifecycle & EOL Policy defines how long Macnman manufactures, supports, and maintains each hardware product.

---

## Purpose of This Policy

This policy ensures:

- Clear communication of a product’s lifecycle  
- Predictable planning for integrators and enterprises  
- Defined timelines for support and firmware maintenance  
- Structured end-of-life announcements  
- Continued device reliability throughout deployment  

---

## Product Lifecycle Stages

Macnman follows four distinct lifecycle stages for every hardware product.

### Active Production
- Product is in full-scale manufacturing  
- Available for standard purchase  
- Receives firmware improvements and optimizations  
- Full warranty and RMA support available  

### Maintenance / Sustaining Phase
This phase begins as the product matures or when a successor model is introduced.

During this stage:
- Product availability continues with longer lead times  
- Firmware updates are limited to security & stability patches  
- No new features added  
- Component substitutions may occur due to supply-chain constraints  

### 2.3 End-of-Life (EOL) Announcement
An official notice is issued when Macnman plans to discontinue a product.

The EOL notification includes:
- Last Order Date (LOD)  
- Last Shipment Date  
- End of Firmware Support date  
- Recommended replacement models  

### 2.4 Post-EOL Support
After discontinuation:
- Warranty for already purchased units remains active  
- Paid repair service continues while spare parts are available  
- Firmware updates provided only for critical issues

A product may reach EOL due to:

- Component unavailability or semiconductor obsolescence  
- Introduction of next-generation models  
- Updated regulatory or certification requirements  
- Adoption of more advanced MCU/RF technologies  
- Reduction in market demand  
- Supply chain discontinuation  

---

## 6. Customer Responsibilities During EOL

Customers should:

- Track EOL announcements
