# How to Raise a Support Ticket

This section explains how to raise a support ticket with Macnman so that your issue is logged, tracked, and resolved in a structured and timely manner.

## Step 1: Collect Required Information

Before raising a ticket, keep the following details ready:

- Company name  
- Contact person name  
- Email address and phone number  
- Product name and model number  
- Serial number / QR code / MAC ID of the device  
- Date of purchase and invoice number (if available)  
- Firmware version (if applicable)  
- Description of the issue (what is happening, since when, how frequently)  
- Installation location (site name, city, project name)  
- Any troubleshooting steps already performed  
- Relevant photos, screenshots, or log files

The more accurate the information, the faster the diagnosis and resolution.

## Step 2: Choose the Support Channel

Currently, Macnman accepts support tickets through the following primary channel:

### 1. Email Support

Send an email to: **support@macnman.com**

Use a clear and descriptive subject line, for example:

- `URGENT – Device not joining LoRaWAN network – MacSync-LWSX5 – Site Mumbai`
- `RMA Request – MacSync-LW-X2 – Optical Rainfall Sensor`
- `Configuration Help – MacLink Gateway – ChirpStack Integration`

### 2. Through Authorized Partner / Distributor

If you purchased the product through an authorized distributor, you may also raise the ticket via that partner.  
They will consolidate the information and escalate the case to Macnman support if required.

## Step 3: Ticket Creation and Reference ID

Once your email is received, the support team will:

1. Log your case in the internal ticketing system.  
2. Assign a **Ticket ID / Reference Number**.  
3. Share the Ticket ID with you via email.

Always mention this Ticket ID in follow-up emails so that the support team can track the history and avoid duplication.

## Step 4: Remote Diagnosis

Depending on the issue, Macnman support may:

- Request additional logs, screenshots, or configuration files  
- Ask you to perform certain tests (e.g., swap power supply, change antenna, move device, etc.)  
- Schedule a remote session or call for deeper debugging  

In some cases, support may request:

- Network server screenshots  
- Gateway logs  
- Field photos of installation (enclosure, cable glands, antenna, orientation, etc.)

## Step 5: Resolution or RMA Guidance

Based on the diagnosis, the support team will either:

- Provide configuration or firmware-related fixes  
- Suggest corrective actions in the field  
- Confirm whether the issue falls under warranty or is a non-warranty case  
- Guide you through the **RMA process** if hardware repair/replacement is required

If RMA is needed, you will be asked to ship the product to Macnman as per the RMA guidelines mentioned in the Warranty Terms & Conditions.

## Priority and Response Time

Tickets are generally handled on a best-effort basis with priority given to:

1. Safety-critical and alarm-related applications  
2. Live production deployments  
3. Pilot/POC systems close to deadlines  

SLA and guaranteed response times may be defined separately in project-specific or enterprise-level support agreements.

## Best Practices for Faster Resolution

- Always include **product model, serial number, and site name** in the first email.  
- Attach clear photos of wiring, antenna placement, and installation environment.  
- Mention any recent changes (new firmware, new network server, new configuration, etc.).  
- Group related issues under the same ticket instead of opening multiple independent threads.

By following this process, you help Macnman support quickly understand the context, reproduce the issue, and provide an efficient resolution path.
